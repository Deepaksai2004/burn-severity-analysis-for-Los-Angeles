# burn-severity-analysis-for-Los-Angeles

This project analyzes burn severity using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. It calculates the **Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR)** and **dNBR** to classify the severity of burned areas.

The Burn Severity Mapping following a fire incident that occurred last month (January). The areas I have analysed are located near Tuna Canyon Park, Topanga State Park, and Pacific Palisades were affected by the fire incident.
I performed the analysis using coding and ArcGIS Pro reclassification, and both methods produced the same percentage values..
This study helps in understanding the extent of damage caused by the fire in these regions...
