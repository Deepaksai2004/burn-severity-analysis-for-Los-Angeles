# burn-severity-analysis-for-Los-Angeles

This project analyzes burn severity using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. It calculates the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and dNBR to classify the severity of burned areas.

Overview:

The Burn Severity Mapping follows a fire incident that occurred last month (January). The analyzed areas include:

Tuna Canyon Park
Topanga State Park
Pacific Palisades
The analysis was performed using Python, and the burn severity percentages remained consistent across different methods. This study helps in understanding the extent of fire damage in these regions.

Requirements
Sentinel-2 imagery (Pre-fire & Post-fire)
Shapefile for the affected area
